# ðŸ“š Bulky Book â€“ ASP.NET Core MVC Project

## ðŸ§  About the Project
This project was created as part of my learning journey in **ASP.NET Core MVC**.  
I built it by following a **YouTube tutorial series** that teaches how to develop a full-featured e-commerce application using modern ASP.NET Core concepts.  
While following the video, I implemented the concepts myself â€” including the **Repository Pattern**, **N-Tier Architecture**, **Entity Framework**, and **Identity Authentication** â€” to better understand real-world ASP.NET Core development.
