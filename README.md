# üìö Bulky Book ‚Äì ASP.NET Core MVC Project

## üß† About the Project
This project was created as part of my learning journey in **ASP.NET Core MVC**.  
I built it by following a **YouTube tutorial series** that teaches how to develop a full-featured e-commerce application using modern ASP.NET Core concepts.  

Throughout the process, I followed the steps from the tutorial while writing and understanding each part of the code myself ‚Äî implementing key concepts such as:
- Repository Pattern  
- N-Tier Architecture  
- Entity Framework with Code-First Migrations  
- ASP.NET Core Identity Authentication & Authorization  
- Integration with external libraries (DataTables, Toastr, SweetAlert2, TinyMCE)

The result is a **functional e-commerce website** where customers can view products, add them to a cart, and make payments.  
Admins can manage categories, products, and orders through a secure dashboard.
